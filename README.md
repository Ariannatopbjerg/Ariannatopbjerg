Hello! My name is Arianna Topbjerg. I am currently enrolled in the UC Berkeley Extensions Data Analytics Bootcamp. I graduated from Humboldt State University in 2019; receiving a B.S. degree in Biology with an emphasis in Ecology and Biodiversity. I am currently looking for jobs pertaining to data analytics, as well as environmental science positions.
If you would like to discuss any of my work I have done in GitHub, please contact me via email at arianna.m.topbjerg@gmail.com :)
